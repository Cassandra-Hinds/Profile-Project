      <p>
        Under the tranny controlling my world I do not live, I exist. And even
        that becomes a chore.
      </p>
      <p>
        I freeze as shivers slither up my spine and tighten around me like
        serpents. Some of the tyrants are nearby.
      </p>

      <p>
        I run to hide behind the nearest building. Cackling rips through my
        ears, and my screams turned into gasps from the sudden lack of air. My
        heart gallops as I fall to my knees and my whole body shakes. The words
        <em>I want to die</em> pound into my mind over and over.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Get a hold of yourself.” I spat. “I am not afraid and I never will be.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I force myself to look around. Where were they if they were so close?
      </p>

      <p>
        Twenty at least are gathered around a house across the street, laughing
        their heads off. I jump when one rips the door off its hinges and three
        people are forced outside. Their wails are inhumane and my eyes widen
        when I realize who they are. My aunt, uncle, and baby cousin!
      </p>

      <p>
        I look away when three of those demons push them face-forward on the
        charcoal payment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything in me wants to go over there and kill all twenty of them. Yet
        their presence from here renders my legs useless and man-made weapons
        don’t work against them anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only thing I could do is watch the relatives I spent every holiday
        with and the cousin I babysat with my brother when my aunt and uncle went
        to scavenge for food, get tormented.
      </p>

      <p>
        Four demons each go into each of them, making them convulse violently,
        and turn their bodies in unnatural ways. They scratch, bite, and even
        pound their heads against the ground. Their sadistic lust holds no
        bounds, even when it comes to hurting a four-year-old.
      </p>

      <p>
        The eight outside my family burn their house down, grinning ear to ear.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I think the horror is done; my relatives start to tear their
        clothes, and the eight demons begin to burn them alive.
      </p>

      <p>Tears blur my vision and I’m glad for it.</p>

      <p>
        What feels like an eternity, the evil presence lifts and I'm free to
        breathe and get up again. When I open my eyes, the demons are gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I clench my fists. One day I will find their weakness. I will not rest
        nor will I stop until all demons are destroyed, even if it kills me.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I open the door to my home and my brother snatches me up in a suffocating embrace on entry. “Asta, I
        was worried to death. Where were you?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I cry in his arms when the image of my relatives floats back to the
        surface. “O-our”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shhh… I saw. I saw.” he soothes me. “When I realized you snuck out
        after curfew again, I-” his voice cracks and he doesn’t finish his
        sentence.
      </p>
      <p>“I can’t play it safe anymore, Ande.”</p>
      <p>
        He holds me at arm's length. His cheeks are steak with tears and his
        eyes are bloodshot, “You don’t mean,”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I do. These demons have been oppressing us for too long, and I’m sick
        of finding and scavenging for trinkets that do nothing. It’s time to go
        to their hotspot.”
      </p>

      <p>“We?”</p>

      <p>“I need my brother, you’re now the only family I have left.”</p>

      <p>
        “Sis, the burning dumps are crawling with demons. We won’t be able to
        get in, let alone find something in there to use against them.”
      </p>

      <p>“We might be able to, we just have to find a way.”</p>
      <p>“How close were you when they killed our relatives?”</p>
      <p>“Right across the street.”</p>

      <p>“How did you feel?”</p>

      <p>“Weak and about die but-”</p>
      <p>
        “And you will feel that one hundred times over if you go to the dumps.
        We will die if we go there.”
      </p>

      <p>“But under their role what do we have to live?”</p>
      <p>He sighs in defeat and locks the door shut. “What is your plan?”</p>
      <p>"Survive."</p>
