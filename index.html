          When I was younger being immersed in water is what calmed me but as I
          grew up it might be what destroys me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was walking alone at night again, something my mom urges me not to
          do. But the grass on my feet and being next to the lake soothes me.
          Sadness, worry, and frustration dissipate at the ripples and the clear
          blue substance. Most importantly I don’t have to hide my gift.
        </p>
        <p>
          I scope the area to make sure no one was there then dived inside. I
          close my eyes as my lungs get used to breathing in the water. It’s
          always a discomfort at first, even after doing it for years. When my
          breathing pattern became normal again and my eyesight underwater
          became clear, I started to have fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currents zipped past me and circled me. I swam in one and rode like a
          bull righter, except I controlled the speed and direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forward, backward, left, right, even upside down at the fastest speed I
          could muster, and even jumped in the air like a dolphin a few times.
          Soon my strength had depleted, and tiredness overtook me like a tidal
          wave. <p> The temptation to sleep here gripped by, but then my ma worried
          sick if I’m gone when she wakes. So with a grown, I use the last bit
          of my energy to have the currents pull me back to the shoreline.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I lay there - getting used to breathing oxygen again - someone
          gripes me by arm and yanks me to my feet. The man before me smiles deviously,
          “You’re coming with me.”
