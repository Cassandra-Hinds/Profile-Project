          <p>
            When I was younger being immersed in water is what calmed me but as
            I grew up it might be what destroys me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was walking alone at night again, something my mom urges me not to
            do. But the grass on my feet and being next to the lake soothes me.
            Sadness, worry, and frustration dissipate at the sight of ripples
            and the clear blue substance. Most importantly I don’t have to hide
            my gift.
          </p>
          <p>
            I scope the area to make sure no one was there then dived inside. I
            closed my eyes as my lungs get used to breathing in the water. It
            was always a discomfort at first, even after doing it for years.
            When my breathing pattern became normal again and my eyesight
            underwater became clear, I started to have fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currents zipped past me and circled me. I swam in one and rode like
            a bull righter, except I controlled the speed and direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forward, backward, left, right, even upside down at the fastest
            speed I could muster, and even jumped in the air like a dolphin a
            few times. Soon my strength had depleted, and tiredness overtook me
            like a tidal wave.
          </p>

          <p>
            The temptation to sleep here gripped me, but then my ma worried sick
            if I’m gone when she wakes. So with a groan, I used the last bit of
            my energy to have the currents pull me back to the shoreline.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I laid there - getting used to breathing oxygen again - someone
            gripped me by the arm and yanked me to my feet. The man before me
            smiled deviously, “You’re coming with me.”

            The threat - no promise - of making it happen or else curls around
            me tight like a python as I sit on my knee in the dark corner of my
            subject's room. He is sleeping soundly in bed for now until I can
            figure out my next course of action.
          </p>
          <p>I have to be strategic; there's no way I'm messing up again.</p>
          <p>I have one job: make sure my subject dies.</p>
          <p>
            With a cackle I slam his bed into his dresser, knocking over a
            one-foot heavy glass vase he placed beautifully at the edge. I grin
            ear to ear as it plummets toward his head. As the vase centimeters
            away from making an impact one of his angels appeared, yanking him
            out the way.
          </p>
          <p>I curse, glaring at the guardian angel.</p>
          <p>
            She towers over my subject - who’s now stirred and fully awake -
            like a mother hen.
          </p>
          <p>“What happened?” he asks getting off the ground.</p>
          <p>
            His eyes widens on the fallen vase on his pillow and his bed against
            the dresser. He’s totally oblivious to me and my adversary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Backing away from his bed as if it were a bomb, my subject looks
            around his room for a cause, anything to explain what just happened.
            His breathing becomes fast and shallow and his body shook. Oh, I
            wish I could read his mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calmly his angel comes up behind him and puts her hands on his
            shoulder. She doesn't have him see her; just to feel her touch and
            hear her voice. “Shh… It’s ok. Everything’s alright.”
          </p>
          <p>“Not on my watch,” I say.</p>
          <p>
            With a snap, I cack everything I can that’s made out of glass. Then
            I flickered the light off and on, adding to his paranoia. And for a
            sweet icing on top, scratched big bold letter on the wall saying,
            You’re going to die.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not being able to take it anymore my subject bolted for the door.
          </p>
          <p>
            His angel snarls down at my triumph, With narrowed fiery eyes she
            said “You will not succeed.” Then disappears.
          </p>
          <p>I smirk, “We’ll see about that.”</p>

            Our world was perfect and tranquil. That until is someone opened it
            up to the kingdom of darkness. From ever since we do not rule on our
            land and sometimes not even our own lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The horrors of evil are now our masters, plummeting our peaceful
            world to utter chaos and fear. And I for one refuse to bow it.
          </p>

          <p>“Where were you?” my brother snaps as walking into the house.</p>

          <p>I gave him a side glance which makes him even more infuriated.</p>

          <p>
            “You know good in well you’re not supposed to out this late. What if
            you’ve been caught?”
          </p>

          <p>“You’re over-exaggerating.”</p>

          <p>
            He gips hold of my arms in earnest and his brown eyes showed more
            worry than anger. “You're all have sis, and if you get caught I lose
            you.”
          </p>

          <p>I smile, “I love you too.”</p>

          <p>
            He sighs heavily, taking me in a hug and kissing the top of my head.
            He takes his job as my older brother way too seriously sometimes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I pull away and grin from ear to ear. “I have come back with good
            news.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I led the way to our sorry excuse for a kitchen. The furniture only
            there is are two old chairs around a small table in the center of
            the room. And I hardly count the rotten-out cabinet and counter-top
            furniture; we never use it and it’ll probably crumble if we do.
            Neither do we use the refrigerator; any silverware and food have
            along with any other possessions considered valuable we hide tuck
            away in case of break-ins - which happens often around here under
            our new masters. At least for now.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I know that smile.” He says pushing in his chair. “Whatever you are
            concocting, can not change this.” vaguely gesturing all around him.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Yes, it can. I’ve found out their weakness. If I could get a hold
            of it I could drive them out. This would mean returning the power to
            us, reverting our world to what it was meant to be.”
          </p>

          <p>
            He raises his eyebrow, “How exactly did you come across such news?”
          </p>

          <p>“I might have went somewhere I was not supposed to be.”</p>

          <p>“You d- where?”</p>

          <p>“By one of the burning dumps.”</p>

          <p>
            No one besides the evil that rules this place is allowed there. It
            is where they burn and or dump anything they deem a threat. It is
            forbidden to look for or recover anything that ends up at a burning
            dump. Most of the time the fear saturated in such a place is enough
            to drive people away.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Two of the devils we call masters we arguing over a book that
            managed to not be burned to ash; saying if anyone we got our hands
            on it, it’ll be to their ruin. I believe that book holds their
            weakness.”
          </p>

          <p>
            My brother shakes his head, “Even attempting to find that book would
            be a death sentence. You know already know the horrors our masters
            do to people not trying to exploit their weakness.”
          </p>

          <p>
            I bit my lip and close my eyes at the rush graphic images. People
            had been burned alive and tortured mentally, physically, or
            emotionally and sometimes all at once. Our also masters have the
            ability to even control our very being from the inside. Torture is
            their sadistic lust and they never tarry from it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I press my hand against my head, trying to clear my mind. “But is
            not worth it? Looking my brother square in eye I continue, “Knowing
            that you had a chance, a slight chance to turn our world to the
            state it used to be - to the state should be- are you not willing to
            risk everything?”
          </p>

          <p>My brother scrunches his face in hesitation.</p>

          <p>
            “We’re going to succumb to death sooner or later by their hands
            anyway, why not die as a hero instead of a victim?”
          </p>

          <p>
            He sits back in his chair, with a sigh. I impatiently study his
            expression until he finally nodded. “Please tell me with this
            suicide run you have a plan.”
          </p>

          <p>I grin, “I thought you’d never ask.”</p>
