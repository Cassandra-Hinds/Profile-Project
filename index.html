          <p>
            When I was younger, immersing myself in water was what calmed me,
            but as I grew up it might be what destroys me.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I’m ambling alone under a starry night and the aroma of damp grass
            fills my nostrils, making me grin. The downpour was exquisite and I
            would’ve been out in rain too but my ma wouldn’t hear of it. At the
            sound of her snore, I was out of the cabin and in the nearby forest.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reaching the lake my smile could not be contained. I sprint toward
            my liquid sanctuary and almost slip on the rocks and wet grass. All
            my responsibilities and all the problems from my life flee at the
            sight of ripples and waves.
          </p>

          <p>
            A snap of a twig makes me stop at the shoreline. My mother’s words
            come to mind:
            <em
              >Let no one see your gift. If people see what you can do they will
              have no problem breaking every humane law there is to figure out
              why.</em
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            I stiffen. Was that movement in the trees I saw? Maybe it was an
            animal. Could it be?
          </p>

          <p>
            My body tingles as the water responds to my racing heart and
            hesitation. The waves grow higher and violent. The water spins
            around in circles going faster and faster.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a minute of silence, I take a deep breath. Nothing to fear.
          </p>

          <p>
            Slowly a smile grows back on my lips and I free fall backwards
            underwater.
          </p>

          <p>
            Time gets lost as I spin around in the water creating currents to
            push me along. My hair is everywhere as I zoom from one direction to
            the next.
          </p>

          <p>
            Laughter erupts from my lungs when I end upside-down and have myself
            spat up to the surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            Soon my strength depletes and tiredness overtakes like a tidal wave.
          </p>

          <p>
            The temptation to sleep here grips me but my ma would be worried
            sick if I’m gone when she awakes. So with a groan, use the last bit
            of my energy to have the currents pull me back to the shoreline.
          </p>

          <p>
            As I lay there gazing at the sky someone grabs me by the arm and
            yanks me to my feet. The man before me smiles deviously, “You’re
            coming with me.”

            The threat - no promise - of making it happen or else curls around
            me tight like a python as I sit on my knee in the dark corner of my
            subject's room. He is sleeping soundly in bed for now. That is until
            I can figure out my next course of action.
          </p>
          <p>I have to be strategic; there's no way I'm messing up again.</p>
          <p>I have one job: make sure my subject dies.</p>
          <p>
            With a cackle I slam his bed into his dresser; knocking over a
            one-foot heavy glass vase placed beautifully at the edge. I grin ear
            to ear as it plummets toward his head. As the vase was centimeters
            away from making an impact one of his angels appeared, yanking him
            out the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I curse, glaring at the guardian angel. Light and love radiate off
            her, and I for one find that repulsive.
          </p>
          <p>
            She towers over my subject - who’s now stirred and fully awake -
            like a mother hen.
          </p>
          <p>“What happened?” he asks, getting off the ground.</p>
          <p>
            His eyes widens on the fallen vase on his pillow and his bed against
            the dresser. He’s totally oblivious to me and my adversary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Backing away from his bed as if it were a bomb, my subject looks
            around his room for a cause, <em>anything</em> to explain what just
            happened. His breathing becomes fast and shallow and his body shook.
            Oh, I wish I could read his mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calmly his angel comes up behind him and puts her hands on his
            shoulder. She doesn't have him see her; just to feel her touch and
            hear her voice. “Shh… It’s ok. Everything’s alright.”
          </p>
          <p>“Not on my watch,” I say.</p>
          <p>
            With a snap, I cack everything I can that’s made out of glass. Then
            I flicker the light off and on, adding to his paranoia. And for a
            sweet icing on top, I scratch big bold letters on the wall saying,
            <em>You’re going to die.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Not being able to take it anymore my subject bolts for the door.
          </p>
          <p>
            His angel snarls down at my triumph. With narrow fiery eyes, she
            says, “You will not succeed,” Then disappears.
          </p>
          <p>I smirk, “We’ll see about that.”</p>

            Under the tranny controlling my world I do not live, I exist. And
            even that becomes a chore.
          </p>
          <p>
            I freeze as shivers slithers up my spine and tightens around me like
            serpents. Some of the tyrants are nearby.
          </p>

          <p>
            I run to hide behind the nearest building. Cackling rips through my
            ears, and my screams turned into gasps from the sudden lack of air.
            My heart gallops as I fall to my knees and my whole body shakes. The
            words <em>I want to die</em> pound into my mind over and over.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Get a hold of yourself.” I spat. “I am not afraid and I never will
            be.”
          </p>

          <p>
            I force myself to look around. Where were they if they were so
            close?
          </p>

          <p>
            Twenty at least are gathered around a house across the street,
            laughing their heads off. I jump when one rips the door of its
            hinges and three people are forced outside. Their wails are inhumane
            and my eyes widens when I realize who they are. My aunt and uncle
            and baby cousin!
          </p>

          <p>
            I look away when three of those demons push them face-forward on the
            charcoal payment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everything in me wants to go over there and kill all twenty of them.
            Yet their presence from here renders my legs useless and man-made
            weapons don’t work against them anyway.
          </p>

          <p>
            The only thing I could do is watch the relatives I spend every
            holiday with and the cousin I baby-sat with my brother when my aunt
            and uncle go to scavenge for food, get tormented.
          </p>

          <p>
            Four demons each go into each of them, making them convulse
            violently, and turn their bodies in unnatural ways. They scratch,
            bite, and even pound their heads against the ground. Their sadistic
            lust holds no bounds, even when it comes to hurting a four-year-old.
          </p>

          <p>
            The eight outside my family burn their house down, grinning ear to
            ear.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I think the horror is done; my relatives start to tear their
            clothes, and the eight demons begin to burn them alive.
          </p>

          <p>Tears blur my vision and I’m glad for it.</p>

          <p>
            What feels like an eternity, the evil presence lifts and I'm free to
            breathe and get up again. When I open my eyes, the demons are gone.
          </p>

          <p>
            I clench my fists. One day I will find their weakness. I will not
            rest nor will I stop until all demons are destroyed, even if it
            kills me.
